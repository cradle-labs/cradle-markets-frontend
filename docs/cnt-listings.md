## Short explainer / tooltip
Cradle Native Tokens (CNTs) are compliant listings that tokenize equity-, revenue-, or profit-linked claims. Listings use a legal wrapper (e.g., SPV/C-Corp/Foundation), enforce KYC/AML, and embed covenants and disclosure schedules. Trading occurs on the Cradle OrderBook with on-chain settlement; violations can trigger suspension and delisting to protect investors.
